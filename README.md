# Vocrab: efficient vocabulary acquisition

**Disclaimer:** This project is still in alpha, [readme-driven](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)
development, so this document may lie from time to time.

Vocrab is a tool for acquiring foreign vocabulary efficiently from "real-world"
texts. With Vocrab, you can:

* Import webpages or copy-paste text for vocab analysis
* Sort vocabulary by how commonly it appears in the text
* Group different forms of the same word together
* View how the words are used in the text
* Create [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcards from Vocrab

## Why does this exist?

From Stephen Krashen's theory on [second language acquisition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiTsduRreug),
the only way humans truly acquire a foreign laguage is through seeing the language
used and understanding what was said.
[Intensive and extensive reading](https://www.fluentu.com/blog/intensive-and-extensive-reading/)
are ways to acquire a foreign language through reading. However, to read at this
level, you have to understand around 90-95% of the words in the text. This is
a problem if you are just starting out with the language.

Vocrab aims to ease the process of getting to 90-95% word comprehension by
following [Heaps' law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaps%27_law) and/or the
[Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). In short,
learn the most frequently used words first to get to 90-95% comprehension
quickly.

## Installation

**TODO**

## Getting started

After starting up Vocrab,

1. Select your target language.
2. Then in the ``Texts`` tab, click ``new`` and then
``from Universal Declaration of Human Rights``.
3. Now, in the ``Vocab`` tab, click on one of the words that looks unfamiliar.
Notice how all usages of the word are now highlighted in the text. You can also
select different forms of the word and select sentences that use the word.
